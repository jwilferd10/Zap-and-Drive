As electric cars continue to gain traction within the United States, the need for convenient EV charging stations has never been greater. Zap and Drive is here to help with that, designed to simplify the search for nearby stations by providing users with essential data such as location, hours, and availability.

### :rocket: Features:
- Optimized interface for easy user access
  - Utilizes Bulma
  - Adjusted for both desktop and mobile devices
- Address List containing nearby stations
  - Clicking/Tapping on an address will zone users to that specific location
- Interactive map icons
  - Designates a charging station
  - When clicked, presents users with information about the charging station
 
### üí≠ Developer Notes:
Future plans for this project include:
- Auto-completing potential states a city-name is located in
- Save addresses on a list and allowing users to populate the map with saved addresses

### üôè Thank You!
So much for viewing Zap and Drive, we hope this application can be useful in any way possible. Thank you again, happy coding!
